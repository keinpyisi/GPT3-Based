# Fine-Tuned GPT-Neo 2.7B Model

This repository contains code for fine-tuning the GPT-Neo 2.7B model using PyTorch. GPT-Neo is an open-source autoregressive language model developed by EleutherAI, capable of generating human-like text across a variety of tasks.

## Overview

This project aims to fine-tune the GPT-Neo 2.7B model on conversational data using PyTorch. The fine-tuned model can then be used for tasks such as chatbot development, dialogue generation, and more.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Transformers library

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

2. Install the required dependencies:

3. Prepare your conversational dataset. Ensure it follows the format mentioned in the code.

4. Fine-tune the model by running the provided script:

```bash
python train.py

```

5. Monitor the training process and evaluate the fine-tuned model based on your requirements.

6. Save the fine-tuned model and tokenizer for future use:

```bash
# Save the model
model.save_pretrained("fine_tuned_gpt_neo_2_7B")

# Save the tokenizer
tokenizer.save_pretrained("fine_tuned_gpt_neo_2_7B")
```

7. Integrate the fine-tuned model into your applications or projects for generating conversational responses.
